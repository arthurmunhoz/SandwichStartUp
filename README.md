# Sandwich Startup
### Created by `Arthur Regatieri Munhoz`

### Description
This application consisted in building an Android app interface for a sandwich restaurant.
Consulting a server through an API, it shows a list of items and some special prices. Once selected all wanted items, it shows the "cart" list and the total price pro the user.
As a challenge, I had only one night to develop.

### Tech stack
- Android
- Java
- REST API (OkHttp3)
- Picasso for image loading
- MVP architecture
